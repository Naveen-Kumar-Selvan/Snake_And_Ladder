# Snake_And_Ladder
This is a Snake and Ladder game where we have players, snakes, ladders, dice and some components.

I have written the Low Level code for this game by following the SOLID principles 
along with some design patterns like Singleton, Factory and Strategy to make the code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.
