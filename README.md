# Snake_And_Ladder
This is a Snake and Ladder game where we have players, snakes, ladders, dice and some components.

I have written the Low Level code of this game in JAVA by following the SOLID principles and also incorporated some of the design patterns like Singleton, Factory and Strategy to make the code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.
